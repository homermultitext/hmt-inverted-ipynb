# hmt-inverted-ipynb

A series of "upside down" Jupyter notebooks working with material from the Homer Multitext project.  The notebooks are organized so that you you first run a set of cells to set up the notebook.  You can then use a cell at the top of the notebook like a spreadsheet where you can experiement with different values for settings.
